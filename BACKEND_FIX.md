# Backend Fix - Logger Error

## Issue
```
ReferenceError: logger is not defined
    at C:\Users\BIGA\Desktop\pathfinder1\backend\src\index.js:31:3
```

## Root Cause
The `logger` utility was being used in `src/index.js` but was never imported.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Added Logger Import
**File:** `backend/src/index.js`

```javascript
// Added this line
const logger = require('./utils/logger');
```

### 2. Made Redis Optional
Changed Redis connection errors from blocking to non-blocking:

```javascript
// Before
redisClient.on('error', (err) => logger.error('Redis Client Error', err));

// After
redisClient.on('error', (err) => {
  logger.warn('Redis Client Error (optional service):', err.message);
});
```

This allows the server to start even if Redis is not running, which is fine for testing the registration flow.

## Result
✅ Backend now starts successfully  
✅ Server runs on port 5000  
✅ MongoDB connection works  
✅ Redis is optional (won't crash if not available)

## Test It
```bash
cd backend
pnpm dev
```

**Expected Output:**
```
[nodemon] starting `node src/index.js`
✓ MongoDB Connected
✓ Server running on port 5000
✓ Environment: development
```

If you see Redis warnings, that's okay - the server will still work for registration testing.
