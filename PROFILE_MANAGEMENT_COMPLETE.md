## 🎯 What's Next

### Frontend Implementation

Now we need to create the frontend profile management:

1. **Profile Page** (`/profile-management`)
   - View profile information
   - Edit profile form
   - Avatar upload component
   - Education/Experience sections
   - Skills management

2. **API Integration**
   - Connect to profile endpoints
   - Handle file uploads
   - Update Redux state

3. **UI Components**
   - Profile form
   - Avatar uploader
   - Education/Experience cards
   - Skills tags

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### Backend is Ready!

1. **Restart backend** (if running):
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. **Test endpoints** using:
   - Postman
   - cURL commands above
   - Or wait for frontend implementation

### Avatar Uploads

Uploaded avatars are stored in:
```
backend/uploads/avatars/
```

And accessible via:
```
http://localhost:5000/uploads/avatars/filename.jpg
```

---

## ✅ Phase 1 Status

### Authentication & User Management

- ✅ Login/Register endpoints
- ✅ JWT token management
- ✅ Password reset functionality
- ✅ **Profile CRUD operations**
- ✅ **Avatar upload**
- ✅ **Settings management**
- ⏳ Session handling with Redis (optional)

**Phase 1 is 95% complete!**

---

## 🎉 Summary

**Backend Profile Management is fully implemented and ready to use!**

All endpoints are:
- ✅ Implemented
- ✅ Protected with authentication
- ✅ Validated
- ✅ Error handled
- ✅ Documented

**Next:** Build the frontend profile page to interact with these endpoints! 🚀
