# ✅ Toast Notifications & Fixes Applied!

## 🎯 What's Been Fixed

### 1. **Toast Notifications** ✅
Replaced all `alert()` calls with beautiful toast notifications using `react-hot-toast`

**Before:**
```javascript
alert('Avatar uploaded successfully!');
```

**After:**
```javascript
toast.success('Avatar uploaded successfully!');
```

### 2. **Avatar Image Display** ✅
Fixed avatar URL to show uploaded images correctly

**Issue:** Avatar URL was `/uploads/avatars/filename.jpg` (relative)  
**Fixed:** Now shows `http://localhost:5000/uploads/avatars/filename.jpg` (absolute)

### 3. **Education & Skills Data** ✅
Fixed data structure to properly display education and skills from backend

**Before:** `skills: { technical: [], soft: [] }`  
**After:** `skills: profile.skills || []`
